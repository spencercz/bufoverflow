# bufoverflow
This repository demonstrates an example of a buffer exploit overflow in C. We provide a compiled executable file, as well as the source code for inspection. See if you can crack it and launch the shell!

When you have cracked the file, you can paste your payload into [CTFUCLA.online](https://ctfucla.online) and the website will verify your payload. Be sure to paste the payload in plaintext.
